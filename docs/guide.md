# Viewport-FPS
Viewport FPS Blender add-on

### About
**Viewport FPS** is a simple Blender add-on that calculates and displays the frames-per-second value in your 3D Viewport. Unlike the built-in FPS counter, which is used to track animation playback frame rate, **Viewport FPS** displays real-time FPS directly in your 3D Viewport at all times.

### Installation
[will be added later]

### Usage
After installing the add-on, you will see a gray label appear under the Snapping toggle. This label displays your current frames-per-second value.

### Preferences and Personalization
To find the add-on preferences, go to:

`Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons`

Type **"Viewport FPS"** in the search field. Click the arrow to expand the add-on information and access the **preferences**.

In the **Preferences** section, you will find settings that change the counter’s appearance and properties:

- **Show "FPS:" Label**: *Shows/Hides the "FPS:" text*
- **Show Decimals**: *Shows/Hides decimal values*

- **Warning FPS**: *If your FPS drops below this value, the display color changes (see Warning FPS Color)*
- **Refresh Every N Frames**: *Updates the FPS indicator every N frames (set to 1 for real-time updates)*
- **Font Size**: *Size of the FPS text*
- **Position**: *The corner from which the offset is calculated*
- **Position X**: *Horizontal offset*
- **Position Y**: *Vertical offset*

- **Normal FPS Color**: *Color used for normal FPS display*
- **Warning FPS Color**: *Color used when FPS drops below the Warning FPS value*
